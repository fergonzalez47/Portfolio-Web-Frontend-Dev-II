            I must develop the good practice of commenting; That will help me understand my code days later,
            as well as other developers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Variables can be defined using dollar signs, underscores, etc. But by convention, the best practice
             is to do it using camel-case notation. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I must limit the use of global variables. Define variables using const and Let.

        </p>
        <p>
            About comparisons: It is recommended to always use hard equiately when testing if two values
            ​are equal. That will help me avoid
            problems caused by JavaScript coercion.
            
           <strong> What is coercion? </strong>:type coercion means that strings can be mistaken for numbers. That's really interesting, and that's why
            I always have to use hard equality or inequality. 
        </p>
            
        <p>
            To remove an element and its Space from an array use:
            ArrayName.splice(IndexNumber,1);
            The 1 means that an element will be removed.
        </p>

        <p>
            About If – else statements: When there are many conditions or verifications in the code, it is preferable to use the switch operator; 
            make the code more readable and easy to understand.
