        <h3>Chapter 5</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>To make an object, it must be declared in braces {}</li>
                <li>Objects can be placed inside another object!
                    Values ​​in nested objects can be accessed by referencing each property name
                    in order using dot or bracket notation</li>
                <li>Despite being declared const, objects are mutable; that is, they can change or be eliminated</li>
                <li>The parse() method takes a JSON file and will transform it into a JavaScript object. This is how I can work with that object</li>
                <li>The stringify() method does the opposite: It transposes the object into a JSON file.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h3>Chapter 6</h3>
        <div><ul>
            <li>Question:
                I don't fully understand how this method works:
                            render(target,content,attributes) {
                                for(const key in attributes){
                                    target.setAttribute(key, attributes[key]);
                                }
                </li>
            <li>The classList Property is one of the things that I liked most about this chapter; I can add
                a class to an element without overriding it. This is the example syntax:
                WonderWoman.classList.add('female warrior');</li>
            <li>To remove it, use the following: WonderWoman.classList.remove('warrior');
                Once removed, it will remain with the previous class it had.
                That property can be useful during real-time form validation, to change
                the styles of a specific class.</li>
            <li>Query selectors are a powerful way to select elements on a page; supports even pseudo-selectors
                to point to a particular element, such as 'li:last-child'</li>
    
        </ul></div>
        <h3>Chapter 7</h3>
        <div><ul>
            <li>The event properties: The screenX and screenY properties show the number of pixels from the left and
                top of the screen respectively where the event took place</li>
            <li>The clientX and clientY properties show the number of pixels from the left and
                top of the client that is being used (usually the browser window).
                The pageX and pageY properties show the number of pixels from the left and top,
                respectively, where the event took place in the document. This property takes
                account of whether the page has been scrolled.</li>
            <li>Playing with them a bit I saw that they mark some kind of coordinate where the event occurred.</li>
            <li>preventDefault() prevents the object's default behavior from executing.
                I must think carefully before using preventDefault() to change default
                behavior because users will expect certain behaviors, and preventing them may cause
                confusion.</li>
                <li>There are two
                    forms of event propagation: bubbling and capturing.
                    event propagation refers to the order in which the event occurs on each element. For example,
                    if I hit a li inside an ul, the event is propagated.</li>
        </ul></div>
