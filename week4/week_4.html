        <h3>Chapter 8 | FORMS</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>A form can be referenced as follows:
                    const form = document.forms.search;</li>
                <li>"forms" refers to a form, and ".search" is the name attribute of that specific form; <i>However, to avoid problems sometimes about calling properties or
                    methods of document.form object</i></li>
                <li>To avoid it,
                    bracket notation can be used (this is also required if the form name
                    attribute contains invalid characters, such as spaces or hyphens):
                    const form = document.forms['search'];</li>
                <li>
                    I can also access form controls as in "input" through its
                    name attributes: <br> const input = form.nombreDeInput;</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h3>Chapter 12 | OOP</h3>
        <div><ul>
            <li>It doesn't matter if you've already created multiple instances of a class or prototype; if you decide later
                add a new method, or a new property, it will be carried over or updated
                automatically in all instances. This is good for saving space and time.</li>
            <li>prototypes must only possess properties that all instances can contain. useless
                write a property that will then be overridden in all instances.</li>
            <li>want to Built-in Objectsm as an Array, it is better to use
                an extension of the class and use my own class with own methods.
                This way I will avoid having problems and behaviors not expected from the program.</li>
