        <h3>Tranisitions | Canvas, SVG, and Drag and Drop</h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>How do I make the transition apply in reverse? that is, when you remove the pointer from a <p>, for example, it returns to its state
                    normal with transition and not abruptly?</li>
                <li>in Transitions, the properties can be in any order; but the duration must always be included before the "delay",
                    in case it is used</li>
                <li> Can multiple transitions be applied to different properties? Yes
                    "In this case, specify all the transition values ​​as a
                    shorthand for each transition, and separate each property’s transition with a comma</li>
                <li>transition-property
                    Specifies the name(s) of the CSS properties to which the transitions should be applied. 
                if a want to apply the transition to all properties, only I have to say "all".</li>
                <li>There are things or properties i can not animate</li>
        
                <li>I also can use transform with percentage %, to state at which point
                    I want a transition to behave in a specific way.
                </li>

        <ul>
            <li>I think it's easier and more practical to draw figures with SVG than using canvas. In fact, I feel that it is less cumbersome</li>
            <li>Making SVG images by hand is very complicated. The good thing is that there are programs and design tools to create them.</li>
            <li>Canvas is prefered to design a game, because probably I will use a lot of animantions.</li>
            <li>Using SVG, I have adventages of accessibility using the DOM.</li>
            <li>About dag and drop:I have to set the draggable attribute on any HTML elements you’d like to be draggable</li>
    
            <li>The main steps to configure Drag-and-drop are: 1) define a "drop zone", that is, define an element where the file can be dropped; and 2) define functions for handling drop and dragover events.</li>
        </ul>
