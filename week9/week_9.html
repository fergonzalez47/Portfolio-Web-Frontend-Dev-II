        <ul>
            <li>The ways for creating cookies: <br>
                document.cookie = 'hero=true';
                <br> >> "hero=true" <br>
                document.cookie = 'city=Metropolis';
                <br>>> "city=Metropolis"</li>
            <li>its values ​​can be reassigned... Simply by reassigning it to document. Example : document.cookie = 'name=Batman'</li>
            <li>the methods for the Window object setTimeout() and setInterval()
                They are very similar.
                I think the difference is that the latter will execute code every certain time interval that we give it as a parameter.
                 </li>
            <li>const Time= window.setInterval(displayConsole(This is a function),1000);</li>
            <li>Then the function will be executed every second</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>data- is an attribute of the element.

                To access it, the following line is used, once the element reference is made:
                const element= element.dataset.[name of data];</li>
            <li>Remember to investigate more examples of the use of Web Workers



.</li>
            <li>                Web Workers
                They work as threads in the background of the program, to prevent the program from freezing while waiting for a response while the code is running.
               
               I actually found it very cool and interesting</li>
            <li>How to use it? const worker = new Worker('name.js');</li>
            <li>There are many interesting events and properties to use with multimedia and javascript.</li>
