            <ul>
                <li>"Feature detection" : guarantees that the method is only
                    called if it actually exists and fails gracefully, without any exceptions being
                    thrown, if the method does not exist. That is really cool, because If a can put some methods into a IF_ELSE statement, it will
                    run only it the condition is true.</li>
                <li>the alert() method is a way to debug the code, because it pauses the program until I hit "ok" on it</li>
                <li>another way (very useful for me) is the console.log;</li>
                <li>remember that : ReferenceError is thrown when a reference is made to an item that doesn’t
                    exist. For example, calling a function that hasn’t been defined.
                    </li>
                <li>The code inside the catch block will only run if an exception is thrown inside
                    the try block. The error object is automatically passed as a parameter.
                    
                    This is especially useful for handling errors that I decide to; I mean to show some message or do something
                     specific when the first condition is not met.</li>
            </ul>
