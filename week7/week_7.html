        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>I can make a function return another function.

                    In this way, the function that returns could contain variables or parameters 
                    }of the main function and thus I can use its values.</li>
                <li>This also allows you to do a greater number of functionalities with the same code, such as more complex
                     mathematical operations.</li>
                <li>asynchronous means that code can run and execute out of time order; that is, time after the trigger fired it.


                    the two cycles of the promises are: Resolved â€• the asynchronous operation was completed successfully.
                    and the other loop is
                    "Rejected"</li>
                <li>I can have separate code for each loop.</li>
            </ul>

        <ul><li>Ajax gives me the facility to make dynamic changes to the web page without refreshing</li>
            <li>I need to learn a little more about php or some language or tool to work from the server.</li>
            <li>The easiest way to work with ajax methods is with JSON files.</li>
            <li>the .then() method
                and the .catch() method will help me work with the promise or response from the server in an orderly manner.
               
               This means that I can execute code depending on what happens. and the status of the event.</li>
